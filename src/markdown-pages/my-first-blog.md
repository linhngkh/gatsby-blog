<strong>Thank you everyone who read this blog post!</strong>

Before learning to code journey, I remembered that around 2010, I used Yahoo Blog platform a lot to write online diary. That time I have no idea how blog or website in general are built. I don't even think that I will go to Finland to study abroad. 
And now is learning to code to become a Front End Developer by learning to build a simple blog website with Gatsby.js. Further, I will develop this blog to be a full stack blog. :)

Never to late to catch up your dream.
